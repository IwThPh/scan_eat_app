# ScanEat Mobile Application

Flutter Mobile Application for interacting with the ScanEat API.

## The Application

This mobile app allows users to create custom food labels, and scan food items to reinterpret the information to suit their needs.
The items can be scanned via the phone's camera or by utilising manual user input.
The system also allows for allergen and dietary highlighting, presenting the user with any warnings should they be present.

## The Development

This project was created for my dissertation project for my third year at Swansea University.
It was designed and developed following a Test Driven Development methodology. 
This repository contains one half of the full system, The remaining portion of the project can be found under the scan_eat_api repository.
